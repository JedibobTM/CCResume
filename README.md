# CCResume

This is my resume submission for the application to Prime Academy. I tried to view resume after creating the repository, but all styling seemed to go away.
I don't know if I'm doing something wrong to view it (I've never used Github before), but if everything it Times New Roman and only black and white, contact me
please. Email: christiancarlson648@gmail.com.
